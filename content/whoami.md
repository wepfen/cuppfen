Actually student in computer science and cybersecurity school [Ecole 2600](https://ecole2600.com/)
and play with my CTF team [0xA28](https://ctftime.org/team/272956).

I spend my time learning new things, [code clashing](https://www.codingame.com/profile/3e194b062e273cc65cf2b9ec22de50845276955) and also skateboarding.

I like [sexy JDM cars](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2b/de/7d/2bde7d14133968f97d6c4dd898edb989.gif) 
and am a drift enthusiaist. I'm also interested in automobile cybersecurity (haven't started learning this tho).
